## Installation

To use this extension you need to add meta_request gem to your app's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  # original meta_request gem is broken. Using fork provided by rails_panel
  gem 'meta_request', github: 'dejan/rails_panel', ref: 'meta_request-v0.8.5'
end
```

After this, install RailsPanel extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/railspanel/gjpfobpafnhjhbajcjgccbbdofdckggg). This is recommended way of installing the extension, since it will auto-update on every new version.

## Install unpacked version

If you have a problem installing extension from Chrome Store or just want to run latest and hack on it, just clone the repo (say under `~/workspace/rails_panel`) and in "Developer mode" Chrome Extensions page select "Load Unpacked extension..." and select `~/workspace/rails_panel/extension`.
